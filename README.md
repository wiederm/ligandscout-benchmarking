# ligandscout-benchmarking

The test_LS_executables.py script tests three LigandScout executables (iscreen, idbgen, espresso) on local computers (a7pc82-87, a7srv2) and on the cluster (hydra) executing 

```bash
python test_LS_executables.py -l /data/shared/software/ligandscout4.2/ -y parameters.yaml 
```
The different behavior of the script is based on the hostname of the computer it is executed on - by default it executes using all availalbe resources, when executed on hydra it submitts to the sge grid engine.

The tests are specified in the parameters.yaml file. There are local and cluster tests, the local tests are executed on local computers and the cluster tests are only performed on hydra. The executables that are used for the local test are specified in the -l parameter of the command line arguments (this is not true for the cluster - the cluster executables must be manually changed in the idbgen_bench.sh and iscreen_bench.sh scripts.

The input data for the tests are located in the data folder, the generated data is temporarly stored for the duration of the test run in the test_data and will be removed at the beginning of the next test run. 

  
Results are written in the test_results directory and plots are generated by executing 
```bash
python plot_results.py
```
in the test_results directory.
